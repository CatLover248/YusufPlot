# WaterGraph
> WaterGraph is a python program that makes a staple graph depending on the 3 valus you input.
> For now this script is very simple, and I will be updating and making improvments over time.
> The name "WaterGraph" Was inspired by one of my chemistry lessson about Water ussage :D
Enjoy using my program and no it is not a virus that steals all of your v-bucks.
